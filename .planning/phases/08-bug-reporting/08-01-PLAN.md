<objective>
Add a "Report a Bug" option to the Settings menu (above "Sign Out") that opens a full-page in-app bug report screen (optional photo + guided description prompts). On submit, send the report to an n8n workflow that forwards it to the admin via Telegram.

Purpose: Create a reliable, low-friction channel for users to report issues with enough context (screenshot + description) to diagnose problems quickly.

Output: Frontend UI + new n8n workflow that delivers bug reports to Telegram in a consistent, review-friendly format.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add "Report a Bug" entry above "Sign Out"</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Locate the Settings modal section in `app/page.tsx` (near the existing "Sign Out" button).
  2. Insert a new Settings action button labeled "Report a Bug" positioned directly above the "Sign Out" button.
  3. Clicking the new entry should close Settings modal if needed and open the new full-page bug report screen.
  4. Keep visual language consistent with existing Settings buttons (same spacing, hover states, icons).
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Open Settings: "Report a Bug" is visible and is above "Sign Out".
  - Tapping it opens the bug report screen.
  </verify>
  <done>Settings contains the new entry in the correct position and it navigates to bug report UI.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build full-page bug report screen UI</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx (new panel/component/state)</files>
  <action>
  Implement a full-page in-app screen (full-screen overlay/panel is acceptable) with:

  - Header with title "Report a Bug" and a back/close control.
  - Privacy note (one line) explaining reports are sent to the team for review.
  - Photo upload control:
    - Optional
    - Single photo only
    - Show selected filename/preview and allow removing/replacing it
  - Description textarea:
    - Single field
    - Prompts visible as helper text/placeholder, including:
      - "How did this occur?"
      - "What happened when you clicked?"
  - Submit button:
    - Disabled unless description or photo is present (avoid empty reports)
    - On submit: block UI and show a loading indicator
  - Cancel/close behavior:
    - If user has entered text or selected a photo, confirm before discarding
    - If empty, close immediately
  - Success behavior:
    - Show brief success confirmation
    - Automatically return to Settings
  - Failure behavior:
    - Show clear error + Retry
    - Preserve textarea content + selected photo

  Match existing full-screen patterns (e.g., Notification panel overlay style) so it feels native.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Close confirmation triggers only when there is unsent content.
  - Submit blocks UI; retry works; inputs persist.
  - Success returns user back to Settings.
  </verify>
  <done>Bug report UI matches CONTEXT decisions and handles all core states.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Wire bug report submit to n8n webhook</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Implement client submit that POSTs to the n8n Bug Report Intake webhook.
  2. Payload requirements:
     - description (string)
     - optional photo (single file)
     - user identity (at minimum user_id; include username/email if available)
     - standard context: timestamp, CURRENT_VERSION, current screen identifier, and basic device/browser info (userAgent)
  3. Handle responses:
     - success: true => show success confirmation then return to Settings
     - rate limited => show friendly error (no data loss) + allow retry later
     - error/timeout => show error + Retry
  </action>
  <verify>
  - With no photo: submits successfully.
  - With photo: submits successfully.
  - If workflow returns rate limit: UI shows message and preserves content.
  </verify>
  <done>Frontend submits the report to n8n and correctly handles success/error/rate-limit responses.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Create n8n workflow "Bug Report Intake"</name>
  <files>n8n workflow (new)</files>
  <action>
  Create a new n8n workflow that accepts the bug report submission and forwards it to Telegram.

  Workflow requirements:
  - Trigger: Webhook (POST) at a stable path (e.g., /webhook/bug-report)
  - Input parsing:
    - description
    - optional photo (binary)
    - user identity fields
    - context fields (timestamp, app version, screen, device info)
  - Rate limiting:
    - Simple per-user throttle
    - Recommended implementation: use Supabase `user_preferences` with a key like `bug_report_last_submitted_at` to enforce time-based throttle
  - Telegram delivery:
    - Destination: admin DM (Telegram user ID)
    - If photo present: send as photo with caption
    - If no photo: send as text message
    - Caption/message includes:
      - user identity
      - description
      - timestamp
      - app version
      - screen
      - device/browser basics
  - Response contract to frontend:
    - JSON with `success: true` on success
    - JSON with `success: false` and `error_code` (e.g., RATE_LIMITED) on throttles
    - JSON with `success: false` and human-readable message on errors

  Use existing Supabase credential:
  - supabaseApi: "JbItbwVcQiGCLFAC" (NemoAIDatabase)

  Telegram credentials:
  - Use a Telegram bot credential configured from the provided bot token.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Workflow validates and executes in n8n
  - With photo: Telegram receives photo + caption
  - Without photo: Telegram receives text
  - Rate limit branch returns RATE_LIMITED JSON
  </verify>
  <done>Bug Report Intake workflow reliably forwards reports to Telegram and returns deterministic JSON to frontend.</done>
</task>

  <name>Task 5: End-to-end verification in the NemoAI UI</name>
  <what-built>Settings entry + full-page bug report screen + n8n intake workflow forwarding to Telegram</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  1. Open Settings and confirm "Report a Bug" is directly above "Sign Out".
  2. Open the bug report screen.
  3. Submit description-only report.
     - Expected: loading state, then success confirmation, then return to Settings.
     - Expected: Telegram DM receives the report with identity + context.
  4. Submit a report with a photo.
     - Expected: Telegram DM receives the photo with caption including the report details.
  5. Try sending multiple reports quickly.
     - Expected: rate limit message appears and no data is lost.
