<objective>
Add a "Report a Bug" option to the Settings menu (above "Sign Out") that opens a full-page in-app bug report screen (optional photo + guided description prompts). On submit, send the report to an n8n workflow that forwards it to the admin via Telegram.

Purpose: Create a reliable, low-friction channel for users to report issues with enough context (screenshot + description) to diagnose problems quickly.

Output: Frontend UI + new n8n workflow that delivers bug reports to Telegram in a consistent, review-friendly format.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add "Report a Bug" entry above "Sign Out"</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Locate the Settings modal section in `app/page.tsx` (near the existing "Sign Out" button).
  2. Insert a new Settings action button labeled "Report a Bug" positioned directly above the "Sign Out" button.
  3. Clicking the new entry should close Settings modal if needed and open the new full-page bug report screen.
  4. Keep visual language consistent with existing Settings buttons (same spacing, hover states, icons).
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Open Settings: "Report a Bug" is visible and is above "Sign Out".
  - Tapping it opens the bug report screen.
  </verify>
  <done>Settings contains the new entry in the correct position and it navigates to bug report UI.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build full-page bug report screen UI</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx (new panel/component/state)</files>
  <action>
  Implement a full-page in-app screen (full-screen overlay/panel is acceptable) with:

  - Header with title "Report a Bug" and a back/close control.
  - Privacy note (one line) explaining reports are sent to the team for review.
  - Photo upload control:
    - Optional
    - Single photo only
    - Show selected filename/preview and allow removing/replacing it
  - Description textarea:
    - Single field
    - Prompts visible as helper text/placeholder, including:
      - "How did this occur?"
      - "What happened when you clicked?"
  - Submit button:
    - Disabled unless description or photo is present (avoid empty reports)
    - On submit: block UI and show a loading indicator
  - Cancel/close behavior:
    - If user has entered text or selected a photo, confirm before discarding
    - If empty, close immediately
  - Success behavior:
    - Show brief success confirmation
    - Automatically return to Settings
  - Failure behavior:
    - Show clear error + Retry
    - Preserve textarea content + selected photo

  Match existing full-screen patterns (e.g., Notification panel overlay style) so it feels native.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Close confirmation triggers only when there is unsent content.
  - Submit blocks UI; retry works; inputs persist.
  - Success returns user back to Settings.
  </verify>
  <done>Bug report UI matches CONTEXT decisions and handles all core states.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Wire bug report submit to n8n webhook</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Implement client submit that POSTs to the n8n Bug Report Intake webhook.
  2. Payload requirements:
     - description (string)
     - optional photo (single file)
     - user identity (at minimum user_id; include username/email if available)
     - standard context: timestamp, CURRENT_VERSION, current screen identifier, and basic device/browser info (userAgent)
  3. Handle responses:
     - success: true => show success confirmation then return to Settings
     - rate limited => show friendly error (no data loss) + allow retry later
     - error/timeout => show error + Retry
  </action>
  <verify>
  - With no photo: submits successfully.
  - With photo: submits successfully.
  - If workflow returns rate limit: UI shows message and preserves content.
  </verify>
  <done>Frontend submits the report to n8n and correctly handles success/error/rate-limit responses.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

- [ ] Settings shows "Report a Bug" above "Sign Out"
- [ ] Bug report screen is full-page and closable with discard confirmation only when dirty
- [ ] Optional single photo upload works
- [ ] Description prompts are visible
- [ ] Submit blocks UI and shows progress
- [ ] Success returns to Settings
- [ ] Error shows Retry and preserves inputs
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Users can submit a bug report (with or without photo) from Settings in under 30 seconds.
2. UX is resilient: retries work, no data loss on errors, and basic throttling is enforced.
