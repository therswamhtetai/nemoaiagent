<objective>
Create the Bug Report Intake n8n workflow and verify end-to-end delivery to Telegram.

Purpose: Ensure bug reports submitted from the UI reach the admin with consistent context and rate limiting.

Output: New n8n workflow that accepts bug report submissions and forwards them to Telegram.

  <name>Task 1: Create n8n workflow "Bug Report Intake"</name>
  <files>n8n workflow (new)</files>
  <action>
  Create a new n8n workflow that accepts the bug report submission and forwards it to Telegram.

  Workflow requirements:
  - Trigger: Webhook (POST) at a stable path (e.g., /webhook/bug-report)
  - Input parsing:
    - description
    - optional photo (binary)
    - user identity fields
    - context fields (timestamp, app version, screen, device info)
  - Rate limiting:
    - Simple per-user throttle
    - Recommended implementation: use Supabase `user_preferences` with a key like `bug_report_last_submitted_at` to enforce time-based throttle
  - Telegram delivery:
    - Destination: admin DM (Telegram user ID)
    - If photo present: send as photo with caption
    - If no photo: send as text message
    - Caption/message includes:
      - user identity
      - description
      - timestamp
      - app version
      - screen
      - device/browser basics
  - Response contract to frontend:
    - JSON with `success: true` on success
    - JSON with `success: false` and `error_code` (e.g., RATE_LIMITED) on throttles
    - JSON with `success: false` and human-readable message on errors

  Use existing Supabase credential:
  - supabaseApi: "JbItbwVcQiGCLFAC" (NemoAIDatabase)

  Telegram credentials:
  - Use a Telegram bot credential configured from the provided bot token.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Workflow validates and executes in n8n
  - With photo: Telegram receives photo + caption
  - Without photo: Telegram receives text
  - Rate limit branch returns RATE_LIMITED JSON
  </verify>
  <done>Bug Report Intake workflow reliably forwards reports to Telegram and returns deterministic JSON to frontend.</done>

  <name>Task 2: End-to-end verification in the NemoAI UI</name>
  <what-built>Bug Report Intake workflow + end-to-end Telegram delivery</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  1. Open Settings and confirm "Report a Bug" is directly above "Sign Out".
  2. Open the bug report screen.
  3. Submit description-only report.
     - Expected: loading state, then success confirmation, then return to Settings.
     - Expected: Telegram DM receives the report with identity + context.
  4. Submit a report with a photo.
     - Expected: Telegram DM receives the photo with caption including the report details.
  5. Try sending multiple reports quickly.
     - Expected: rate limit message appears and no data is lost.

<verification>
- [ ] Workflow validates and executes in n8n
- [ ] Telegram receives correct format (photo+caption when present)
- [ ] Simple per-user rate limit is enforced
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Admin receives actionable Telegram messages that include identity + context.
2. Reports are throttled per user to prevent spam.
</success_criteria>
